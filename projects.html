            <p>Authorized Phishing-Awareness Simulation (Local Lab) I will create an isolated, local-only lab using a mock company and mock adversary to simulate phishing scenarios against myself.
Moreover, I will build a mock email workflow and a mock company website using Python, Flask, and HTML to observe form interactions, session behavior, and logging.
Then I will analyze logged interactions, perform threat modeling, and produce recommendations for detection, remediation, and create user-awareness training. Over the course of this project
I will emphasize ethical practice: all testing will be confined to isolated environments with no real user data. The companies used in this project will be made up, and no real data will be forwarded to a real company's site.
            </p>
            <p>Skills that will be showcased: Python, Flask, HTML, logging/analytics, threat modeling, security awareness.</p>
