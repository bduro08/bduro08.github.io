            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Work in progress...</p>
            <p>My name is Brandon Durocher. I'm a senior Cybersecurity student at SNHU with a current GPA of 3.12.</p>
            <h3>Future academic goals: (//combine this line with the next\\)</h3>
            <p>After earning my Bachelor of Science in Cybersecurity, I plan to pursue an MBA with a concentration in Information Technology Management to better bridge the gap between cybersecurity and business.</p>
            <h3>Technical interests: </h3>
            <p>Although my main interest is in Cybersecurity, I also have a very keen interest in Networking and Cloud Computing. 
            I have knowledge of networking concepts but only a little hands-on experience. Furthernore, although I don't have much knowledge of Cloud Computing, 
            I am highly interested in learning more and know I will be able to pick up concepts relatively quickly.</p>
